# ### 🔹 **Basic Understanding**

# 1. **Q: What is the purpose of the `Chat` class in this code?**
#    **A:** It is used to create a rule-based chatbot that replies based on predefined pattern–response pairs.

# 2. **Q: What is the use of the `reflections` variable?**
#    **A:** It’s a dictionary that maps first-person pronouns to second-person (like "I" to "you") to make conversations more natural, though we aren’t customizing it here.

# 3. **Q: What does the `pairs` list represent?**
#    **A:** It contains tuples of regex patterns and their corresponding bot responses. The chatbot uses this to match user input and reply accordingly.

# ---

# ### 🔹 **Regex and Input Handling**

# 4. **Q: What does the pattern `r'(?i)track order (\d+)'` mean?**
#    **A:** It matches phrases like “track order 123”. `(?i)` makes it case-insensitive, and `(\d+)` captures the digits (order number).

# 5. **Q: Why are `.*` used in some patterns like `(.*)place an order(.*)`?**
#    **A:** To allow the phrase “place an order” to appear anywhere in the sentence, ignoring the words before and after.

# 6. **Q: What is the purpose of the `get_response()` function?**
#    **A:** It checks if the user input is about order tracking and handles it manually using regex. Otherwise, it uses the chatbot’s default logic.

# ---

# ### 🔹 **Data and Response Logic**

# 7. **Q: How is order tracking implemented in the code?**
#    **A:** Through a dictionary named `orders` that maps order IDs to their status. The bot uses regex to extract the ID and fetch the response from the dictionary.

# 8. **Q: What happens if a user enters an unknown order ID?**
#    **A:** The bot responds with “No info found for order #<id>”.

# 9. **Q: How does the bot respond to unknown or unrecognized input?**
#    **A:** It uses the fallback rule `(.*)` and responds with “Sorry, I didn’t understand that.”

# ---

# ### 🔹 **Chat Loop and Execution**

# 10. **Q: What is the purpose of `if __name__ == "__main__":`?**
#     **A:** It ensures that the chatbot runs only when the script is executed directly, not when it is imported.

# 11. **Q: How can the user exit the chatbot?**
#     **A:** By typing “quit”, which ends the chat loop and exits the program.

# 12. **Q: What will happen if the user types 'Hi'?**
#     **A:** The bot responds with “Hello! How can I help you?” based on the matching regex pattern.

# ---

# ### 🔹 **Extension/Conceptual**

# 13. **Q: How can you add more product categories to the bot?**
#     **A:** By appending to the `products` list. It will automatically update in the bot’s response.

# 14. **Q: How can this chatbot be improved to understand more natural language?**
#     **A:** By integrating NLP tools like spaCy or transformers, or by using a ML/DL-based chatbot model.

# 15. **Q: Can this chatbot remember the user's previous messages?**
#     **A:** No. It is stateless — each input is handled independently.
