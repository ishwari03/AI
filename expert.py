# üß† General Conceptual Questions
# 1. What is an Expert System?
# Answer:
# An expert system is a computer program that simulates the decision-making ability of a human expert. It uses rules and facts to make deductions and solve problems in a specific domain.

# 2. What type of expert system is this?
# Answer:
# This is a rule-based expert system, which uses if-then logic to infer conclusions (diagnoses) based on user input (symptoms).

# 3. What is the knowledge base in your code?
# Answer:
# The diseases dictionary is the knowledge base, where each disease is associated with a set of symptoms.

# 4. What is inference in expert systems?
# Answer:
# Inference is the process of reasoning based on known facts and rules to draw conclusions. In this system, inference checks if the user's symptoms match the rules for a disease.

# 5. What is the inference technique used in this system?
# Answer:
# This system uses forward chaining ‚Äî it starts from the given facts (symptoms) and checks which rules (diseases) they satisfy.

# üß™ Code-Based Questions
# 6. What data structure is used to represent symptoms? Why?
# Answer:
# Sets are used to represent symptoms because they allow efficient membership checking, automatic elimination of duplicates, and easy comparison using set operations like issubset().

# 7. How does the system collect symptoms from the user?
# Answer:
# It iterates over all known symptoms and asks the user if they have each symptom using input().

# 8. What does the issubset() function do in your code?
# Answer:
# It checks whether all symptoms of a disease are present in the user‚Äôs input symptoms.

# 9. Why is all_symptoms created separately?
# Answer:
# To avoid asking duplicate symptoms for diseases that share them, and to generate a unique list of all possible symptoms.

# 10. Can your system diagnose multiple diseases at once?
# Answer:
# Yes, if the user's symptoms satisfy more than one disease rule, it lists all matching diseases.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Functionality Questions
# 11. What will happen if the user has some, but not all, symptoms of a disease?
# Answer:
# That disease will not be diagnosed, as the code only matches diseases where all symptoms are present (issubset).

# 12. How can the system be improved to support partial matches or probabilities?
# Answer:
# By introducing a threshold or similarity score, we could match diseases based on partial symptoms or using machine learning.

# 13. Is the system dynamic? Can it learn new diseases?
# Answer:
# No, it is static. New diseases or symptoms must be manually added to the diseases dictionary.

# 14. How would you handle conflicting diagnoses in a more advanced system?
# Answer:
# Use weights, confidence levels, or consult additional medical data or decision trees to resolve ambiguity.

# üí° Extension/Thought Questions
# 15. How would you add severity to symptoms in this system?
# Answer:
# By asking follow-up questions to rate each symptom's severity (e.g., mild, moderate, severe) and modifying diagnosis rules to consider this.

# 16. Can this system be integrated into a GUI or web app?
# Answer:
# Yes, the core logic can be integrated into a front-end using Flask (for web) or Tkinter (for GUI).

# 17. What ethical concerns should be considered before deploying such a system?
# Answer:
# It should have a disclaimer that it's not a replacement for professional medical advice, and data privacy must be ensured.
