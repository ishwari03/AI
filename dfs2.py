# ## ðŸ§  **Basic Viva Questions**
# ### 1. **What is Depth First Search (DFS)?**
# DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along one branch before backtracking.

# ### 2. **What is Breadth First Search (BFS)?**
# BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the neighbors of a node before moving to the next level.

# ### 3. **What data structure is used in DFS?**
# DFS uses a **stack** (implicitly via recursion).

# ### 4. **What data structure is used in BFS?**
# BFS uses a **queue** to keep track of nodes to visit.

# ### 5. **Which traversal is better for finding the shortest path?**
# **BFS** is better for finding the shortest path in an **unweighted graph**.

# ### 6. **Is your graph directed or undirected?**
# It is an **undirected** graph (both directions are added in adjacency list).

# ### 7. **What is the time complexity of DFS and BFS?**
# Both DFS and BFS have a time complexity of **O(V + E)**, where:
# * V = number of vertices
# * E = number of edges

# ### 8. **How do you handle visited nodes?**
# We use a **set called `visited`** to track nodes that have already been visited.

# ### 9. **What will happen if we donâ€™t mark nodes as visited?**
# It can lead to an **infinite loop** or revisiting nodes unnecessarily.

# ### 10. **What are some real-life applications of DFS and BFS?**

# * **DFS:** Solving mazes, puzzles, cycle detection.
# * **BFS:** Shortest path in navigation, social network friend suggestions.

# ### 11. **What is the base case for DFS recursion?**
# The base case is when a node is already in the visited set.

# ### 12. **Why do we use adjacency lists instead of adjacency matrices?**
# Adjacency lists are **more memory-efficient** for sparse graphs (less edges).

# ### 13. **Can DFS and BFS be used on trees?**
# Yes, trees are a special type of graph. Both algorithms work on trees as well.

# ### 14. **What is the difference between a tree and a graph?**
# * A **tree** is a connected graph with no cycles.
# * A **graph** may have cycles and need not be connected.

# ### 15. **Why is BFS implemented iteratively and DFS recursively?**
# * BFS needs a **queue** to maintain order â€” best done iteratively.
# * DFS naturally fits **recursion** due to its depth-oriented behavior.
