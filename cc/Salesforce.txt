3.	Create Bank application in SalesForce.com using Apex programming Language.


ChatGPT said:
Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to create a simple Bank Application in Salesforce.com using Apex, covering object creation, Apex code, and basic logic like deposits and withdrawals.

üîß Step 1: Create Custom Objects in Salesforce
Go to Setup ‚Üí Object Manager ‚Üí Create New Object.

1.1 Create Bank_Account__c Object
Label: Bank Account

Plural Label: Bank Accounts

Object Name: Bank_Account

Enable: Allow Reports, Activities

1.2 Add Fields to Bank_Account__c
Field Label	API Name	Type
Account Number	Account_Number__c	Text
Customer Name	Customer_Name__c	Text
Balance	Balance__c	Currency
Account Type	Account_Type__c	Picklist (e.g., Savings, Current)

üíª Step 2: Create Apex Class for Bank Operations
Go to Developer Console ‚Üí File ‚Üí New ‚Üí Apex Class.

Class Name: BankOperations
apex
Copy
Edit
public class BankOperations {

    // Method to deposit amount
    public static void deposit(String accountNumber, Decimal amount) {
        Bank_Account__c acc = [SELECT Id, Balance__c FROM Bank_Account__c WHERE Account_Number__c = :accountNumber LIMIT 1];
        acc.Balance__c += amount;
        update acc;
    }

    // Method to withdraw amount
    public static void withdraw(String accountNumber, Decimal amount) {
        Bank_Account__c acc = [SELECT Id, Balance__c FROM Bank_Account__c WHERE Account_Number__c = :accountNumber LIMIT 1];
        if (acc.Balance__c >= amount) {
            acc.Balance__c -= amount;
            update acc;
        } else {
            throw new AuraHandledException('Insufficient balance!');
        }
    }

    // Method to view balance
    public static Decimal viewBalance(String accountNumber) {
        Bank_Account__c acc = [SELECT Balance__c FROM Bank_Account__c WHERE Account_Number__c = :accountNumber LIMIT 1];
        return acc.Balance__c;
    }
}
üß™ Step 3: Test in Anonymous Window (Developer Console)
Go to Debug ‚Üí Open Execute Anonymous Window, and try the following examples:

apex
Copy
Edit
// Deposit 1000 to account
BankOperations.deposit('ACC1001', 1000);

// Withdraw 500 from account
BankOperations.withdraw('ACC1001', 500);

// View balance
Decimal bal = BankOperations.viewBalance('ACC1001');
System.debug('Balance: ' + bal);
‚úÖ Optional Enhancements
Add Triggers to log transactions.

Create a Transaction__c object to record history.

Use Lightning Web Components (LWC) for a UI front-end.

üìò Summary
Component	Purpose
Bank_Account__c	Custom object for storing accounts
BankOperations	Apex class with deposit/withdraw/view methods
Anonymous Apex	Used to test and invoke methods

Would you like to extend this to include a transaction log or a Lightning UI component next?

how to verify now


ChatGPT said:
To verify that your Bank Application in Salesforce works correctly, follow these steps using both the Salesforce UI and Developer Console:

‚úÖ Step 1: Verify the Custom Object and Record
A. Go to the App Launcher:
Click the App Launcher (9 dots) ‚Üí Search for Bank Accounts.

Open the Bank Account tab.

Create a new Bank Account record:

Account Number: ACC1001

Customer Name: John Doe

Balance: 5000

Account Type: Savings

‚úÖ Step 2: Test Apex Methods via Developer Console
A. Open Developer Console:
Click your avatar ‚Üí Developer Console

B. Open Execute Anonymous Window:
Go to: Debug ‚Üí Open Execute Anonymous Window

To deposit:
apex
Copy
Edit
BankOperations.deposit('ACC1001', 1000);
Click Execute.

To withdraw:
apex
Copy
Edit
BankOperations.withdraw('ACC1001', 500);
Click Execute.

To view balance:
apex
Copy
Edit
Decimal bal = BankOperations.viewBalance('ACC1001');
System.debug('Balance: ' + bal);
Click Execute, then go to Logs ‚Üí open the most recent log ‚Üí search DEBUG.

You should see:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Balance: 5500
‚úÖ Step 3: Confirm in UI
Go back to the Bank Accounts tab.

Open record ACC1001.

Check if the Balance field is now updated to reflect the changes.

üîÑ Optional: Add Debug Logs
To see method activity in logs:

In Setup, go to Debug Logs.

Add yourself as a monitored user.

Re-run the Apex methods.

Open logs to see the method flow and values.

Would you like to set up a trigger or transaction history to track all operations next?







You said:
where is app launcher
ChatGPT said:
The App Launcher in Salesforce is located in the top-left corner of the Salesforce interface.

Here‚Äôs how to find and use it:

‚úÖ Steps to Open the App Launcher
Login to Salesforce (https://login.salesforce.com)

On the top-left corner, look for the grid icon (9 dots in a square shape) ‚Äî this is the App Launcher.

It‚Äôs usually just to the left of the ‚ÄúHome‚Äù tab or ‚ÄúSetup‚Äù gear icon.

Click the App Launcher icon.

A search bar will appear where you can type the name of your app or object.

üîç Example: Open Bank Accounts
After clicking the App Launcher, type Bank Accounts.

Click on the Bank Accounts item (your custom object).

You‚Äôll now see the list of records or the ‚ÄúNew‚Äù button to create a new Bank Account.

If you're not seeing the object:

Ensure you‚Äôve added the Bank_Account__c object to a custom app or a Lightning app page.

Or navigate via Object Manager ‚Üí Bank_Account__c ‚Üí Tab Settings and ensure it's set to "Default On".

Would you like help creating a custom tab for Bank Account to show it directly in the app bar?

System.QueryException: List has no rows for assignment to SObjec


ChatGPT said:
The error you're getting:

System.QueryException: List has no rows for assignment to SObject

means that your SOQL query didn‚Äôt return any records, but you're trying to assign the result directly to a single object variable.

üîç Cause
In your code, you likely have something like this:

apex
Copy
Edit
Bank_Account__c acc = [SELECT Id, Balance__c FROM Bank_Account__c WHERE Account_Number__c = :accountNumber LIMIT 1];
If no matching Bank_Account__c record exists with that Account_Number__c, it throws this error because it's trying to assign a null result to a non-list SObject.

‚úÖ Solution
Wrap your query in a try-catch, or use List<Bank_Account__c> and handle empty results safely:

apex
Copy
Edit
List<Bank_Account__c> accList = [SELECT Id, Balance__c FROM Bank_Account__c WHERE Account_Number__c = :accountNumber LIMIT 1];

if (!accList.isEmpty()) {
    Bank_Account__c acc = accList[0];
    // Proceed with deposit/withdraw logic
} else {
    System.debug('No account found with Account Number: ' + accountNumber);
    // Optionally throw a custom error
    throw new AuraHandledException('Account not found.');
}
üîÑ Or: Use getSObjectType() with try-catch
apex
Copy
Edit
try {
    Bank_Account__c acc = [SELECT Id, Balance__c FROM Bank_Account__c WHERE Account_Number__c = :accountNumber LIMIT 1];
    // Do something with acc
} catch (QueryException e) {
    System.debug('Error: ' + e.getMessage());
    throw new AuraHandledException('Account not found.');
}
‚úÖ Tip for Testing
Make sure you have created a record with that specific Account Number (ACC1001) via:

App Launcher > Bank Accounts > New

Would you like help writing a safer version of your deposit() and withdraw() methods with this logic built in?

        } else {
            throw new AuraHandledException('Account not found');
        }
    }

    public static Decimal viewBalance(String accountNumber) {
        List<Bank_Account__c> accList = [SELECT Id, Balance__c FROM Bank_Account__c WHERE Name = :accountNumber LIMIT 1];
        if (!accList.isEmpty()) {
            return accList[0].Balance__c;
        } else {
            throw new AuraHandledException('Account not found');
        }
    }
}

System.AuraHandledException: Script-thrown exception
ChatGPT said:
The error you're seeing:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
Line: 10, Column: 1  
System.AuraHandledException: Script-thrown exception
means that your Apex method explicitly threw an exception, likely from this line in your code:

apex
Copy
Edit
throw new AuraHandledException('Some error message');
This is expected behavior if something went wrong, such as:

The Bank_Account__c record with the given name (Account Number) was not found.

Or you're trying to withdraw more than the current balance.

‚úÖ How to Fix and Debug This:
Let‚Äôs go step by step to figure it out.

üîç Step 1: Check the Account Number
In your Execute Anonymous window or code, if you‚Äôre calling:

apex
Copy
Edit
BankOperations.deposit('ACC1001', 1000);
Make sure that ‚ÄòACC1001‚Äô actually exists as the Name (Account Number) on a Bank_Account__c record.

üîß If your object uses Auto Number, the generated name might be something like BA-00001, not ACC1001.

‚úÖ Go to the Bank Account tab in Salesforce ‚Üí Open a record ‚Üí Check the value in the Name column.

üß† Step 2: Modify Apex to Debug
Modify your BankOperations class temporarily like this:

apex
Copy
Edit
public static void deposit(String accountNumber, Decimal amount) {
    List<Bank_Account__c> accList = [SELECT Id, Balance__c FROM Bank_Account__c WHERE Name = :accountNumber LIMIT 1];
    System.debug('Record count: ' + accList.size());
    
    if (!accList.isEmpty()) {
        Bank_Account__c acc = accList[0];
        acc.Balance__c += amount;
        update acc;
    } else {
        throw new AuraHandledException('Account not found: ' + accountNumber);
    }
}
Then execute:

apex
Copy
Edit
BankOperations.deposit('BA-00001', 1000);
Check the debug log to see if it fetched a record or not.

‚úÖ Recommendations:
Use the actual auto-generated Name of the record (e.g., BA-00001).

You can also query with a different field (like Customer_Name__c) if that's what you're using as an identifier.

If you want to avoid this confusion, change the object setup to use Text instead of Auto Number for the Name field.

Would you like me to adjust the code to use Customer_Name__c or Id instead of Name to make it easier to test?

Thanks! Based on the details you shared, your Bank_Account__c record has:

Account Name: Aditya_P

Account Number: ACC1001

Customer Number: 1001

Balance: $5,000.00

Account Type: Savings

‚úÖ To Run a Transaction Like Deposit or Withdraw
You mentioned getting an error when trying to deposit or withdraw. Let‚Äôs ensure your code is working correctly with Account Number.

‚úÖ Updated Apex Code for Deposit
Make sure your BankOperations Apex class is written like this:

apex
Copy
Edit
public class BankOperations {
    public static void deposit(String accNum, Decimal amount) {
        List<Bank_Account__c> accList = [
            SELECT Id, Name, Balance__c 
            FROM Bank_Account__c 
            WHERE Account_Number__c = :accNum
            LIMIT 1
        ];

        if (!accList.isEmpty()) {
            Bank_Account__c acc = accList[0];
            acc.Balance__c += amount;
            update acc;
        } else {
            throw new AuraHandledException('Account not found with Account Number: ' + accNum);
        }
    }
}
Now run this in the Developer Console ‚Üí Execute Anonymous Window:

apex
Copy
Edit
BankOperations.deposit('ACC1001', 1000);
‚úÖ For Withdraw:
apex
Copy
Edit
public static void withdraw(String accNum, Decimal amount) {
    List<Bank_Account__c> accList = [
        SELECT Id, Name, Balance__c 
        FROM Bank_Account__c 
        WHERE Account_Number__c = :accNum
        LIMIT 1
    ];

    if (!accList.isEmpty()) {
        Bank_Account__c acc = accList[0];
        if (acc.Balance__c >= amount) {
            acc.Balance__c -= amount;
            update acc;
        } else {
            throw new AuraHandledException('Insufficient funds in account: ' + accNum);
        }
    } else {
        throw new AuraHandledException('Account not found with Account Number: ' + accNum);
    }
}
‚úÖ What to Check If It Still Fails:
Ensure the field is actually called Account_Number__c in your object (not Name, AccountNumber__c, or something else).

You can go to Object Manager ‚Üí Bank_Account__c ‚Üí Fields and confirm the field name.

In case you're using the Name field (standard Salesforce field), adjust query accordingly:

apex
Copy
Edit
WHERE Name = :accNum
Would you like a full working code including balance check, deposit, and withdraw in one class?

You said:
give me complete code
ChatGPT said:
Here is the complete working Apex code for your Salesforce bank application using Apex, with deposit, withdraw, and balance check functions. It assumes that:

The object is named Bank_Account__c

You are using a custom field named Account_Number__c (type: Text) to store account numbers like ACC1001

The field Balance__c stores the balance as a number

‚úÖ Complete BankOperations Class
apex
Copy
Edit
public class BankOperations {

    // Method to deposit amount
    public static void deposit(String accNum, Decimal amount) {
        Bank_Account__c acc = getAccountByNumber(accNum);

        update acc;
        System.debug('Deposit successful. New Balance: ' + acc.Balance__c);
    }

    // Method to withdraw amount
    public static void withdraw(String accNum, Decimal amount) {
        Bank_Account__c acc = getAccountByNumber(accNum);
        if (acc.Balance__c >= amount) {
            acc.Balance__c -= amount;
            update acc;
            System.debug('Withdrawal successful. New Balance: ' + acc.Balance__c);
        } else {
            throw new AuraHandledException('Insufficient balance for withdrawal.');
        }
    }

    // Method to check balance
    public static Decimal checkBalance(String accNum) {
        Bank_Account__c acc = getAccountByNumber(accNum);
        System.debug('Current Balance: ' + acc.Balance__c);
        return acc.Balance__c;
    }

    // Utility method to fetch Bank Account record by Account Number
    private static Bank_Account__c getAccountByNumber(String accNum) {
        List<Bank_Account__c> accList = [
            SELECT Id, Account_Number__c, Balance__c
            FROM Bank_Account__c
