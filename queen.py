# ### ðŸ”¹ **Basic Understanding**

# 1. **What is the N-Queens problem?**
#    âž¤ It is a problem of placing `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard so that no two queens attack each other â€” i.e., no two in the same row, column, or diagonal.

# 2. **What is Backtracking?**
#    âž¤ Backtracking is a method of solving problems by trying partial solutions and then undoing ("backtracking") when we hit a dead end.

# 3. **What is Branch and Bound?**
#    âž¤ Branch and Bound is an optimization of backtracking that prunes branches (choices) early if they are guaranteed not to lead to a solution.

# ### ðŸ”¹ **Algorithm-Specific**

# 4. **How does Backtracking solve N-Queens?**
#    âž¤ It places a queen row by row, checking if it is safe. If placing a queen causes conflict later, it backtracks and tries a different position.

# 5. **Whatâ€™s the difference between Backtracking and Branch and Bound in this problem?**
#    âž¤ Both use recursive methods. Branch and Bound uses sets to quickly check if a column or diagonal is already under attack, which makes it faster.

# 6. **What data structures are used in Branch and Bound?**
#    âž¤ Sets to store `columns`, `diag1 (row - col)`, and `diag2 (row + col)`.

# 7. **What is the time complexity of the N-Queens problem?**
#    âž¤ Worst-case: **O(N!)** for Backtracking. Branch and Bound can improve performance in practice but has the same worst-case complexity.

# ### ðŸ”¹ **Coding and Logic**

# 8. **What does `abs(board[i] - col) == abs(i - row)` mean?**
#    âž¤ It checks if two queens are on the same diagonal.

# 9. **Why do we reset `board[row] = -1` after recursive call?**
#    âž¤ This is part of the backtracking process â€” to undo a move before trying the next column.

# 10. **What happens if no safe column is found in a row?**
#     âž¤ The function backtracks to the previous row and tries a different column.

# ---

# ### ðŸ”¹ **Advanced / Tricky**

# 11. **Can we use the same algorithm for N-Rooks?**
#     âž¤ Yes, but N-Rooks only need to avoid rows and columns, not diagonals â€” making it simpler.

# 12. **What happens if `n=2` or `n=3`?**
#     âž¤ No solutions exist for 2 or 3 queens.

# 13. **Why do we use `row - col` and `row + col` in Branch and Bound?**
#     âž¤ They uniquely represent the two diagonals on a chessboard.

# 14. **Is this problem NP-complete?**
#     âž¤ No, N-Queens is not NP-complete. It can be solved in polynomial time for many practical values of `n` using smart algorithms.

# 15. **How many solutions are there for 4 queens?**
#     âž¤ There are **2 unique solutions** for 4 queens.
